	<text>In order to join Duty, you'll need to get the approval of one of the group's most respected fighters. And also prove to the leader of Duty that you are worthy of being one of them.</text>

	<text>Barkeep: You've got a protective prototype to cover you from the Scorcher, I know the coordinates of the bunker. Don't forget that the prototype won't be able to protect you from the radiation indefinitely, so you must make your way to the bunker under the antennas as quickly as possible and shut down the Burnout. All we have to do is get to the antennas and shut them down.</text>

	<text>Met with the Barkeep. After looking through the documents from Agroprom, he suggested that this X-18 is located in the so-called Dark Valley and suggests that I go there to search for information and documents. He says he's already sent debt scouts on a mission to infiltrate this catacomb. But they're gone. The Barkeep suggested that they had been captured by bandits - they had a base nearby. And if that's the case, then everything the Dutyers have dug up will be at the leader of the bandits - Borov. The Barkeep, urges caution and... and there's obviously something he's not telling us about this catacomb. Alright, let's get to work. First talk to Borov, and if the "conversation" succeeds, then go underground.</text>

	<text>Alright! I'm ready to go to the Scorcher. From Psycho I learned the time of the lowering of the radiation power and about a safe place where I could wait for that time. At other times, my psi defenses wouldn't help anyway, I'll have to find the entrance to the underground bunker of the X-19 lab, and inside, the way to control the Brain Scorcher's antennas.</text>
