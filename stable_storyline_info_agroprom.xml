		<text>Well! The stash gave me a further direction for my search. I found a flash drive that Gunslinger group used as a sort of "logbook". There weren't many messages there, but it was enough to understand - Gunslinger's group, except for him, included 2 others: Ghost and Fang. A certain "mutual acquaintance" was also mentioned, but whether he was part of the group is unknown. But the fact that he was of considerable assistance to Gunslinger group is a fact. Further, Ghost reports that Fang died when they were ambushed. So... So far we have the name of one person who knows Gunslinger for a fact, and that's Ghost. Finally something concrete. And Gunslinger himself, judging by the correspondence, should really be sought in the northern parts of the Zone.</text>
