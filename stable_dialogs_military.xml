		<text>Hey, stalker! What are you doing here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_8002">
		<text>I'm here on business. Can you tell me where your main man is?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_8003">
		<text>Go to the main hall.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_0">
		<text>Hi. Looks like you're settling in nicely.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_1">
		<text>Good for you, too. Yeah, we picked a quieter place, so to speak. but there's a lot of crap in town.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_2">
		<text>How do you guys survive here? It's almost contagious.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_3">
		<text>Yeah, almost. This area's relatively clean, that's why we hang out here. In fact, if the occasion arises, we'll go somewhere else. It wouldn't be the first time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_zoneguard_common2_4">
		<text>Take care.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bhar_0">
		<text>Anything else?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bhar_1">
		<text>Well, you've shown that your intentions in finding what you're looking for are very convincing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bhar_2">
		<text>You're right. So what do you want us to do this time?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bhar_3">
		<text>We need raw materials. Not food, no. Not even artifacts. Raw materials.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bhar_4">
		<text>What are you talking about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bhar_5">
		<text>Flesh.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bhar_6">
		<text>You mean mutated flesh? What, you need to catch flesh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bhar_7">
		<text>No, you misunderstand me, stalker. We need the dead flesh of small animals. Bring some rat and crow carcasses. I think that'll be enough for us.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gdhs_0">
		<text>You can have your animals.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gdhs_1">
		<text>That's fine.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gdhs_2">
		<text>I hope you won't need anything else?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gdhs_3">
		<text>Well, you've done your job. Get out of here while you're still alive. Since who knows if you'll be able to be reborn next time...</text>

	<string id="what_for_went_to_zone_0">
		<text>I hear you're looking for something in the Zone. Can you tell me more about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_for_went_to_zone_1">
		<text>About six months ago, there was a major incident. As you know, there are many settlements around the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. So, one day, the children of all the surrounding settlements went deep into the Zone, and they didn't come back. I tried to find out what happened to them, but to no avail...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_for_went_to_zone_2">
		<text>I had a vision at the Pripyat school. I saw a man and a child. Then the other one became a mutant, I woke up, and, would you believe it, there was a dwarf next to me. So I killed him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_for_went_to_zone_3">
		<text>Hmm. that clears up a few things.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_for_went_to_zone_4">
		<text>I hope so.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_try_do_0">
		<text>What are you gonna do next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_try_do_1">
		<text>Well, I can't go to the Big Land - after I told people about what happened to the kids, they won't let me rest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_try_do_2">
		<text>What about here in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_try_do_3">
		<text>I'll stay here. I'm used to the local life. You can't get used to it, though. I guess I'm just adapting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="what_try_do_4">
		<text>I see.</text>

		<text>Hello, Gunslinger.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="j_bar_1">
		<text>Journalist?!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="j_bar_2">
		<text>Yes. I'm ready to answer your questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="j_bar_3">
		<text>What happened to me on my first trip to the center of the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="j_bar_4">
		<text>You and a group of stalkers went to the center of the Zone through Pripyat. Right after the first big blowout. As you followed a group of military men, there was a second explosion. What happened next, I don't know. All I know is that you somehow survived and were sent back to the barrier on a "death truck".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="j_bar_5">
		<text>What do you know about the Black Monolith?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="j_bar_6">
		<text>Black Monolith is also known as the "Wish Granter". You know, some things are actually quite different in reality than they appear at first glance. The Monolith is just an illusion. A weapon in the hands of those who are behind what's happening here. The center of the Zone is not at the power plant, but further from it, and all the mysteries can be solved there. I think if you manage to get to the Monolith, we can figure out how to find a way to the center of the Zone.</text>

	<string id="j_bar_7">
		<text>I'm going to the Sarcophagus... I think I know what I want.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gds_0">
		<text>The stalkers are dead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gds_1">
		<text>Did you get anything out of their conversation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gds_2">
		<text>They were going to attack your base.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="gds_3">
		<text>Morons! They didn't stand a chance anyway. And you, in turn, have shown your worth... twice-born. We're watching you with increasing interest. You're living up to our expectations of you, stalker.</text>

	<string id="ds_0">
		<text>Greetings...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ds_1">
		<text>Oh, it's the new guy. We just got back from a raid here. This out base, more or less, although sometimes we move around so to speak... You didn't happen to come from Yantar, did you? Chrome said some guy is doing business with the Professor... doing all sorts of orders for him and being very efficient at it. We know about you. But, uh, make sure to back up your reputation, okay? Once you do, you can talk to our boss. So listen up. We got a squad coming back from a raid from Yantar. And something really bizarre happened - we lost their signal in the school district. I'm afraid something went wrong. Why don't you go check it out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ds_2">
		<text>All right, I'll check it out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ds_3">
		<text>Some other time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="as_0">
		<text>The squad was taken over by a controller. I was able to kill it, and your guys are on their way back, safe and sound.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="as_1">
		<text>Holy shit. Thank you, it must have followed them all the way from Yantar. They mentioned that their transmitter kept malfunctioning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="as_2">
		<text>Yeah, that's probably what happened.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ds2_0">
		<text>Do you have any more work?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ds2_1">
		<text>We're thinking of expanding, and there's some shit going on in the building across the street. Glass shards are flying out, guns are being ripped out of patrolmen's hands. Something ain't right. We don't have a lot of people here right now, and nobody wants to go in there, and you're a brave guy, you've proven yourself. You want to check it out?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ds2_2">
		<text>I'll do it. I'll see what's going on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ds2_3">
		<text>Some other time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="as2_0">
		<text>There were several poltergeists in the building. That explains all the stuff you mentioned previously. They won't bother you again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="as2_1">
		<text>Thanks again for your help, stalker. You know, there's not a lot of people like you in the zone. Not everyone could help with something like this.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="as2_2">
		<text>You're welcome, good luck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ds2_kvest">
		<text>Check the building</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_0">
		<text>I can thank you for that. After that mess at the roadblock, I had to run north to get away. Radiation's a good thing. I don't think the military's gonna be here now. I don't need them. Even with our business ties, they had a grudge against me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_bodyguard_dialog_1">
		<text>The Sinners. They're some crazy dudes. One of them came here the other day, went to the counter, stood there silently for ten minutes, and then left without a word. It was a fucking horror movie. And then last night, I was just about to close up. This bunker's got good doors, and a couple of these stoners came in. They're standing over there in the corner staring at me. I tell them to get the fuck out, and they don't give a shit. Fuck them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_max_dialog_2001">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1000">
		<text>What do you want here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1001">
		<text>I got a message from your leader.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1002">
		<text>A message. very interesting.</text>

	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1003">
		<text>Who are you?</text>

	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1004">
		<text>Does it matter?</text>

	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1005">
		<text>Not really, I guess.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1006">
		<text>That's right, stalker. Oh, by the way. You have to give me an artifact. The artifact is a dead head.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1100">
		<text>No.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1101">
		<text>Then get out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1102">
		<text>Alright. (chuckles)</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1200">
		<text>Here you go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mil_screw_dialog_1201">
		<text>Then let's make this deal.</text>
