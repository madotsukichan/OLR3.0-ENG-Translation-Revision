Here, in Bar, you can find it in the field, near the entrance to the administrative building of the Rostok plant.\nKamaz - 8000 rubles. For large transportation. The car is serious, with good cross-country ability. Here, in Bar.\nLada - 5000 rubles, on the highway for 130 squeezes out, but on the off-roads you can not go much, also here in Bar, in one of the garages.\nAnd BTR - 15000 rubles. Don't ask where from, just selling.  Here in Bar. What would you prefer? Yes, and first show enough cash to buy. Otherwise, we won't talk. And keep in mind one thing - you shouldn't leave cars in the zone, they'll steal them before you know it.

Once the rigs started working there, they got out, but I've been there a couple times. They're into some kind of weapons stuff, some kind of research. Anyway, They had this thing called gun lubricant. Well, it had a special effect - the barrel doesn't break from the shots! That's the thing. I used to visit them, so I managed to get some of this stuff. And I've got exactly one barrel left of this miracle solidol... As a token of my gratitude, for a symbolic sum of one thousand I can treat your machine gun, for example. Take it, it's useful, your gun will last you a long time.</text>

		<text>There was once a stalker named Gunslinger. He was a legend from the beginning, that he came from the outside world. Though he didn't like to talk about it himself.
Well, the Zone. it has a peculiar way of dealing with memory. Maybe it just encourages people to forget the past that doesn't suit them.
I, on the other hand, had already merged so much with the Zone that it treated me special now. The Zone not only accepted me, but also allowed, as a favorite child, all sorts of small liberties. In particular, I remember much more than most of the other inhabitants of the Zone. For example, where zombies come from. Strange as it may seem, the main mass was supplied not by the Controllers, or even by the RD units... The zombies were coming from somewhere in the north, there must be another city there, behind the force barrier of the RD units. Maybe that was the outside world where Gunslinger was originally from. But more likely it was another city. I vaguely remember that once the Professor and I, and the one who later became known as the Great Kree, also came from the City! But where is it and what is it, and why did they actually come to the Zone? And what is the Zone...? That remains to be seen...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="doc_bar_12">
		<text>Gunslinger was obsessed with the idea of finding out how the Zone works. And he managed to visit the city where the zombies come from. And somewhere nearby, according to the legends, was supposed to be the Black Monolith. But something there did not work out, somehow he crossed paths with the Angels of the Zone, the "uncles" of the "Sin" clan, for whom their "nephews" were worthless to them. And one day at dawn the zombies brought what was left of Gunslinger to my doorstep. And I actually put him back together virtually piece by piece. And Gunslinger stubbornly went north again...first time I've ever seen such stubborn people try to step on the same rake several times. Gunslinger already knew the legend of the Black Monolith, and even the version that it was a space tunnel. Or a time tunnel. After all, no one who had gone there had ever returned. Unless you count zombies, of course. I mean, they can't all be dead. But there's nothing in the Zone that can't happen. Anything can happen in the Zone.
And then there was a rumor that Gunslinger had returned in the Death Trucks and now he knew the truth about the Monolith. Not everyone believed that he was completely oblivious to it. I examined what the Trucks had delivered several times. The stalkers' bodies had been subjected to something monstrous. Surely something similar had been done to the consciousness, it could even be determined by the altered structure of the brain, but in practice it could not be confirmed, the Death Trucks were so named because so far they had only found dead people in them.
But the Journalist, he was strange, he was looking for something special. In particular, he, one of the few, believed in the legend of the children of the Zone. He'd actually met Gunslinger before both of them got into trouble. Each in their own, of course, but the Journalist seemed to be less fortunate. What's more, the Journalist had managed to dig up some papers somewhere that supposedly dealt with memory. Some kind of special experiments. And it was the Journalist who scattered certain information tags across the Zone. He believed that these tags would at some point help Gunslinger get to the Monolith. Despite the rather detailed information, Gunslinger did not feel satisfied. So far, all he had learned in crumbs was what he had done before, what he was looking for, what he wanted. And it was not at all clear why he had done it and why he had done it. And the deeper past was still there... or rather, as if it never existed!</text>

		<text>Uh... I don't think so. But wait, I think there was one who came in about seven days ago and showed me something that looked like documents. I didn't take it, I didn't want to mess with it... It looked like what you wanted. I don't know where the guy is now, but, uh, I can help. I can give you two options. Okay, first one. I'll conduct a little search, try to find him using my channels. Once I do, I'll get a lead on his location. It won't cost you that much, just five grand. Or the second option, I'll use my powers to the max and get you those documents. I mean, you'll buy them from me, so to speak. It'll cost you fifteen grand. What's up?</text>

	<string id="wolfbar1t">
		<text>Yeah, here's our bar. There's the buffalo. They say he's the one that has been the furthest north. He even saw the outline of the power plant. the heart of the Zone. And there's Hmyr, he's a bit of an "a-hole", but he managed to survive being exposed to the radiation from the RD unit. Usually the effects are similar to those of the Controller, and what's left after that can't be considered human at all. But the Dick's okay. He's alive, but he's weird.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="wolfbar2t">
		<text>With a relatively empty head, new information is much easier to digest. Even if some of the words look like mysterious abbreviations, and some of them are perceived as meaningless symbols. By the way, maybe you can tell me what's outside the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="wolfbar3t">
		<text>You shouldn't treat him like that. He's Rat 5, but unlike the previous ones, he's been in this place for more than half a year. And as you can see, there are plenty of people who want his place. But what's more, he's organized an uninterrupted supply of food and ammunition--</text>
	</string>
	<string id="wolfbar4t">
		<text>There's no way I had nothing to do with Gunslinger. A lot of people knew him, even Rat was afraid of him. But I, strangely enough, no one remembers me. But this can't be possible - the death trucks come from the very depths of the Zone - so I was there, and to go there unnoticed... Something's wrong! I couldn't have come from the north. Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. Tell me, Wolf, do you like living in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="wolfbar5t">
		<text>A lot of stalkers have tried to get past RD installations. Some say they did. But no one's seen them since. You're the first, not counting zombies, to ride in the trucks of death with almost no visible damage. Speaking of zombies, there are a few in the neighborhood, looking for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="wolfbar6t">
		<text>Many will try to fall on your tail as you move towards the power plant, Rat in particular. The black monolith is something akin to oil and diamonds: where it is, there is greed, betrayal and death. People are not even frightened by what they say: as if it fulfills only the underlying, most cherished dreams. And can't we, living in such conditions, be suspected, for example, of an underlying desire... self-destruction?</text>

	<string id="bar_pdarstalker_story">
		<text>Oh, that's respect for the old man. Now, listen to me. I told you I've been a lot of places, and believe it or not, I've been to the power plant too. It's dead quiet. not a soul. Only occasionally in the distance I heard the howling of the zombies. I approached the power plant itself, and I saw the Dark One - he was standing on the roof of the sarcophagus, looking into the distant bloody glow... And then a flash. And that was it. I woke up at Freedom's base, I don't even know how I got there. But I was there, all the regulars will tell you! In general, Hmyr in the bar can still tell you something about the northern territories, ask him...</text>

	<string id="magnet_start_q_five_5">
		<text>Well, I will not reveal all the cards... I will say, it is some modification of the barrel with the properties of the Magnet. First of all, in theory, it should increase the killing power. Second, the bullet should have more momentum. However, there are concerns about the velocity of the bullet, which may be slightly reduced...</text>

	</string>
	<string id="magnet_start_q_tri_done_5">
		<text>I like your approach. To the point. Our institute received an order from an overseas company to develop high-capacity rechargeable batteries. Perhaps you've heard of Zombified stalker fanatics? Or maybe you've come face-to-face with them? It doesn't matter. The point is that they are rumored to have some kind of weapon that uses high-capacity batteries as a combat charge. Sort of like a Gauss weapon.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="magnet_start_q_tri_done_6">
		<text>Is that the kind of weapon you want to get your hands on?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="magnet_start_q_tri_done_7">
		<text>No. Not exactly a weapon. It's the charges that we're interested in. Using our research in magnetic properties, we could create something more effective. In theory, of course. We need one sample of the Magnet artifact, as usual, plus one sample of this Gauss weapon battery. It doesn't have to be fully charged, just get us that battery.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="magnet_start_q_tri_done_8">
		<text>Alright, I'll try.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dok_mag_1">
		<text>Good afternoon, stalker. Yes, you make a good point. We're a small scientific group that's formed here on Duty's territory. It's a safe place, and we get a lot of support from the group. You see, some of the security services are interested in our work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dok_mag_2">
		<text>Our group is studying a type of so-called anomalous formations. Locals call it the Magnet artifact. Here's the data for your PDA. It describes its basic properties. The thing is, this anomalous formation has very interesting properties in terms of anti-gravity waves, which we're studying. I would like to inform you that at the moment we have a shortage of material for research, so if you have these anomalous formations, we will be able to conduct the experiments we need. If the experiment is successful, we can reward you in a special way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dok_mag_3">
		<text>One of the overseas corporations that specializes in the study and production of holograms is interested in the illusory properties of this anomalous specimen.

	<string id="zzzzsnikz_0">
		<text>Hello.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zzzzsnikz_1">
		<text>Hello. Have you been able to find out anything about the missing group?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zzzzsnikz_2">
		<text>The group was captured by Sin, as you suspected. I managed to rescue them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zzzzsnikz_01">
		<text>Yes, I'm picking up their signal! I think they're already here. Thank you, stalker! You did a great job! As a thank you, as promised, there will be a car outside the bunker. You can have it. Thanks again!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="prstugdhs_0">
		<text>I found what you asked for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="prstugdhs_1">
		<text>Really? They're lucky you walked by.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="prstugdhs_2">
		<text>Can they be free now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="prstugdhs_3">
		<text>Yes, we'll let them go after a while... There's something we need to do with them before we let them go. Go, we'll keep our word.</text>

	<string id="stugdhs_0">
		<text>Who's in the next room?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stugdhs_1">
		<text>Do you care? A group of scientists. Went to the wrong place at the wrong time. Just in time for our ritual to begin. Their heads will come in handy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stugdhs_2">
		<text>Wait, you want their heads? No, that's no good. I want to buy them back from you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stugdhs_3">
		<text>Buy them back?! You can't help us with money. Although, if you need it that badly. Bring three dead heads and they'll be free.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hhhnikz_0">
		<text>Are there any tasks for payment?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hhhnikz_1">
		<text>Uh... Yeah. Within a month, we sent four teams to different parts of the Zone to investigate. The first one died on Cordon, near the tower. The second was the one you found in the City. One disappeared here, at the lake, but the fourth, we don't know its fate yet...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hhhnikz_2">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hhhnikz_01">
		<text>All I know is that they disappeared in the Silent Hills. You know who's running the place, don't you? Those lunatics, the Sinners? I suppose it's possible they're at their base and may still be alive. If you're there, try to help our group. They're the only personnel we have left. Help us, and you'll get a special reward.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="silgrav_0">
		<text>I guess now we can talk about why I'm here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="silgrav_1">
		<text>Messer, you are certainly a very valuable specimen. You've certainly done a very good job for us, but listen. In order for us to make business contact with you regarding your case, get me two strong gravitational artifacts. After that, we can talk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="silgrav_2">
		<text>I'll try. But where do I find them?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="silgrav_01">
		<text>At the gravitational anomalies. You're not new to the Zone! Or you could generate one yourself. You know, there are these things that synthesize artifacts from several others. Keep in mind that the artifacts need to be identified by an expert, or else I won't accept them from you. Alright, you find the artifacts, then we'll talk about the rest.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="psilgrav_0">
		<text>Here's your artifacts. I hope I can talk to you now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="psilgrav_1">
		<text>Well done, stalker. I think we're gonna get along just fine. I understand you and the Barkeep are having a conversation about those papers you found in the lab under the Dark Valley. I don't mind discussing those findings, but my time is valuable. So you're gonna have to do a little more work for us. You're all for it, aren't you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="psilgrav_2">
		<text>What do you mean?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="psilgrav_01">
		<text>The usual stalker routine. You're a good fighter, a natural. I think I've even seen you before. but where-- But that's not important. Let's get to work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yaabneayb_0">
		<text>Got another job?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yaabneayb_1">
		<text>You ever heard of the Sinners? Totally badass dudes. Rumor has it they're holed up in the Hills somewhere near Radar. The leader's not even human. He was one of the first stalkers in the Zone. In short, it's one of the oldest groups in the Zone, they've been here since before all this happened. So, I know that at their base, there on the Hills, there is a building with various documents. Anyway, there's something I need. One folder of documents. Maybe you can get it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yaabneayb_2">
		<text>I'll try, but no promises.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yaabneayb_01">
		<text>Thank you! If you can get it, be careful with it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mnb_0">
		<text>Here, take a look at this folder.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mnb_1">
		<text>So... You were able to steal it from the base? Well done, stalker. This is going to help us a lot with our, uh, exploration of the Zone. I heard there was a bit of a commotion at their base. You don't know about it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mnb_2">
		<text>I had one not so pleasant experience with these people. What about payment?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mnb_01">
		<text>Uh, yeah, sure. Thanks again for your help.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ggzxroz_0">
		<text>Look, there's something. Are you interested in a false eye?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ggzxroz_1">
		<text>Hmm. It's rare! In the Zone, if anyone needs it... Anyway, come on, 500 rubles.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ggzxroz_2">
		<text>Here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ggzxroz_01">
		<text>Interesting thing. You'll need it. Come over sometime, we'll play pool with you. You're running around the Zone like a madman.</text>

	<string id="svdodddkz_0">
		<text>The Professor sent you, didn't he?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svdodddkz_1">
		<text>Yes. And I'm interested in something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svdodddkz_2">
		<text>Interested in something... I'm interested in something too. These scientists have placed the radiation from their fucking Psi machine right in front of our base. Which is not good. Our people say the radiation is growing, it'll reach the base soon! Anyway, they're doing something in the hut on the left side of the road to the Hills... I don't want to send my men there. There's so much radiation there, the grass is vaporized. Why don't you go down there and see if you can turn that shit off? We'll talk after. I'm sorry, I have a shipment coming in.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="svdodddkz_01">
		<text>Alright.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dodddkz_0">
		<text>Doctor?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dodddkz_1">
		<text>Yeah. I knew you'd come.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dodddkz_2">
		<text>I have a few questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dodddkz_01">
		<text>Not all at once. I need your help. Afterwards, I'll help you with your questions. Listen up! A stalker wandered into the swamps here. He's been lying by the fisherman's cabin to the east for half a day. Bring him here. But don't take him inside, let him sit on the porch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mzdodddkz_0">
		<text>Hey, you okay?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mzdodddkz_1">
		<text>Ah? Who's there? Stalker! Shit, help! I came from Radar. There, there's, uh, radiation!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mzdodddkz_2">
		<text>I've got it. There's a doctor nearby, I think he can help you!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="mzdodddkz_01">
		<text>Doctor?! Yes, hurry up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pdodddkz_0">
		<text>Doctor, I brought him. He says he's come from Radar.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pdodddkz_1">
		<text>I'll keep him outside for a while. Go and find out where he's from and who he is, and check his things.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pdodddkz_2">
		<text>Okay, got it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="pdodddkz_01">
		<text>Wait, there's more! After you talk to that stalker, go to the trader. His name is Toad. Maybe you already know him. He's a rookie to the Hills. You need to pick up a strange-looking container and bring it to me. If you do, you'll get a free treatment from me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dopdodddkz_0">
		<text>First things first. Who are you and where are you from?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dopdodddkz_1">
		<text>Ah? I'm Bullfrog. Me and a group from Shining Path went out toward Radar through the warehouses. But there, it's literally mind-blowing. I don't know how I got out in the dark and came here. I crossed a broken bridge, had to swim across the river.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dopdodddkz_2">
		<text>So, I see you don't have anything special. Machine gun, walkie-talkie. Right. The Doctor needs something to take you in. I'll bring him this stuff after the Doctor sees you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dopdodddkz_01">
		<text>Yeah, okay. Thank you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jopdodddkz_0">
		<text>Toad, hello. Doctor sent me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jopdodddkz_1">
		<text>Come from the swamps, have you? You're a real piece of work, lad. I thought you wouldn't last a couple of days in the Zone, and here you are! Alright, take it, the Doctor's reported you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jopdodddkz_2">
		<text>Shit. How much does it weigh?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jopdodddkz_01">
		<text>You'd think. If it doesn't fit, put your stuff in the bedside table, you can take it back later. It's not going anywhere. I guess.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hjopdodddkz_0">
		<text>Doctor, I've got what you asked for.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hjopdodddkz_1">
		<text>Good. Well, one more errand, then I'll answer your questions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hjopdodddkz_2">
		<text>Good.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="hjopdodddkz_01">
		<text>That stalker seems to be getting better. He said he was traveling with a group from the city. Maybe he's a member of some kind of group. Go down to the city and ask around about him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zzhjopdodddkz_0">
		<text>Hey, you know Bullfrog?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zzhjopdodddkz_1">
		<text>What? I know him, yeah. He disappeared on Radar a while back with a group. We used to send units up north at one time, one of them was rumored to have even gotten into the power plant. They found some documents, but they were lost there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zzhjopdodddkz_2">
		<text>The Doctor's got him in the swamp. Alive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zzhjopdodddkz_01">
		<text>Oh, dear. We'd already said goodbye to him, and then... Oh, such great news! Well, give the Doctor our thanks. I think what he learned there will be useful to us. We'll have to get in touch with him, have him send him back to us when he's back on his feet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="nnnnnikz_0">
		<text>I think it's this knife.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="nnnnnikz_1">
		<text>Yeah, that's the one. Good job. You've been a great help to me on this case. Why don't you have a drink? It's on me. It's a good occasion. I've been wanting this thing for a long time. I've got a collection of knives.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="nnnnnikz_2">
		<text>You wanted to share information, didn't you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="nnnnnikz_01">
		<text>Don't you respect me? Well, well, well, look. You're looking for Gunslinger, right? Long story short, I heard in a bar from a stalker, in a robe or cloak, badly beaten up, that Gunslinger had hideouts in several places. Like at the Research Institute and here in the Rostok catacombs. Our guys are digging there now, so maybe the closed tunnels are accessible now. Alright, walk on, teetotaler. before the first anomaly.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="nnnnnikz_0133">
		<text>Uh, huh. let me see. Is that the right knife? You didn't mix it up? Okay, I'll believe it. but I'll check.  You're looking for Gunslinger, right?

		<text>Is there any other work?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="nloudmoth_1">
		<text>For you, I'll always find an adventure. Yeah. You need to find a knife in the basement of the Rostok factory, which was lost by a stalker, one of my so-called regulars... Now there are stalkers cleaning out those cellars after you killed that bloodsucker, and this guy I know is with them. I think he lost it in one of the catacomb rooms. He was drinking himself into a stupor last night when he noticed he'd lost it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="nloudmoth_2">
		<text>I'll look for it. What about payment?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="nloudmoth_01">
		<text>I hear you're looking for someone. I think you'll find this information useful. Bring the knife and we'll talk.</text>

	<string id="loudmoth_0">
		<text>You okay, stalker? Did you send the SOS?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loudmoth_1">
		<text>Yes... Help me, damn it. I ran away from that military base, I don't think it was the military at all! I don't think they were even human!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loudmoth_2">
		<text>What are you talking about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loudmoth_01">
		<text>We were coming from Bar. They were following us. They took us to their base. They put Sergei on a pole. One of them was doing some kind of ritual. Shit, after that, I think my brains went to shit! Ahh.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="device_pda_uchenyh_deadcity_desc">
		<text>Last entry: Shit, I think there's a military raid on this house. The memory also contains information about psi installations in Lake Yantar, the swamp area, and the Pripyat area. There is mention of the Black Monolith project, but the information is encrypted.</text>

	<string id="duudpomosnikz_2">
		<text>Yeah, I think they hid in the attic of one of the houses when the military stalkers cleared the city. Here, they had this PDA on them. I have no idea why the military attacked your group.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="zuudpomosnikz_1">
		<text>A week ago, a group of scientists went into town to make observations and disappeared. It's hard to say what could have happened to them. The city's crawling with zombies and whatnot.

We need to find the scientists or their corpses and find the results of the observations, if there are any.</text>

		<text>What kind?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zcddaqiyorbar_3">
		<text>I used to have a brother who worked at the factory, Vanya, or rather Ivan Ivanovich. I had a big fight with him once, over nothing, I went away for a long time. When I came back, I found out that everyone had been evacuated from the plant, but Vanya had not returned. The administration somehow tried to talk themselves out of it, saying that he had either run away or died in the factory. The family burned out all their nerves. Later I received a letter from the Research Institute, an invitation to participate in an expedition in the Zone, or rather, in its protection. I thought to refuse, but I remembered that the plant is also in the Zone, and I had nothing to lose. In short, for the fact that you go to Rostok and find documents that may say something about my brother, or my brother himself, or his personal belongings, I give you a suit. Alright?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zcddaqiyorbar_4">

	<string id="ddaqiyorbar_1">
		<text>Shit, you're alive. I can't believe it, and I don't know how you did it. No matter what anyone says, I'm sure you're-- you're the chosen one. And now you're a full-fledged comrade of the group.</text>

Now, the current rumor is that there's a partially open path to the north. I think you know what that is. Then again, like I said, maybe that's where you'll find your Gunslinger. Anyway, The Barkeep and I have an agreement for an expedition into the radar territory. He's put you in charge of the expedition, which I'm all for. Talk to him about it.</text>

		<text>Just think, the freedom fighters found ten crates of bolts on Rostok. Not just any bolts, but some kind of irradiated bolts. Anyway, they're supposed to take them back to the Big Land, so I'm keeping an eye on them. As for artifacts, I synthesized them once. I had a portable transmuter, I even have the recipes in my PDA.

		<text>That's great! Let's get right down to business. Anyway, Duty has a piece of equipment that's of interest to another faction. It's rare, it's the only one in the Zone. MANPADS. Have you heard of such a toy? Anyway, Go to Rostok, there's a warehouse on top of a roof. You can get there by climbing a wooden ladder on the alley filled with chemical anomalies. Our man from Duty should meet you there. You meet him, we'll decide on the spot. It's simple. The reward will be more than worth it, believe me.</text>

		<text>Hey, Messer. I'm a stalker with the Clear Sky group. There aren't that many of us, and we work with regular single stalkers. If you're interested in helping us, you can go to the central complex of the Agroprom Research Institute. Our group is there right now, they're probably looking for people like you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="skay_1">
		<text>Clear Sky? This is the first I've heard of your group. Well, if I get a chance, I'll meet your guys.</text>

		<text>Thanks, Messer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bar_0">
		<text>Did you send me that text?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bar_1">
		<text>Yeah. Actually, we usually just use guys like you right off the bat. Monsters love fresh stalker flesh. But I know you're here for a reason.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bar_2">
		<text>I have a mission here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bar_3">
		<text>Hmm. What are you talking about?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bar_4">
		<text>I'm looking for some documents. I got a tip that they're right here in this place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bar_5">
		<text>Yeah, we have them. I can give them to you, but not for nothing. You do a couple dirty deeds for me, you'll get your papers. There's some stalkers behind the base near the bar crossing. They're definitely sniffing around. We need to get close to them, overhear what they're saying, and then finish them off!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bar_6">
		<text>Shit. Alright. I hope you keep your word.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="g_bar_7">
		<text>Go, stalker.</text>

	<string id="st_dialog_0">
		<text>Barkeep.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_dialog_1">
		<text>Poor bastard, but that's fate. He's not the first, he's not the last. So, how are you? You're alive, no brain damage? No, you have the same look in your eyes as when we first met.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_dialog_2">
		<text>I'm fine. The machine is shut down, there's no more psi radiation on the lake, the Phantasm seems to be gone too...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_dialog_3">
		<text>Good. So, judging from the documents you brought me from the lab under the Dark Valley, it's clear that the installation under Yantar and the Phantasm were generating a psi-field protecting another area. Another more powerful antenna, Woodpecker 1. which covers all the way north.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_dialog_4">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_dialog_5">
		<text>There's an entrance to an underground complex in the Radar territory. It's most likely the control center for this Woodpecker. But it's not that simple. It's suicide to go to the radar alone, so, as you probably already know, Duty and I are going to organize a joint expedition, in which you'll play one of the central roles. Right now, we've got Duty scouts on a raid to find out what's going on. Besides, we need some time to properly equip the squad, because the raid is going to be very serious. That goes for you, too. So I suggest you start preparing for this sortie thoroughly, and then when everything is ready, I'll tell you what to do next. Yeah, there's a new group of scientists in the swamps, I hear they're bringing in weapons from the Big Land. I think it makes sense for you to pay them a visit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_dialog_6">
		<text>Alright.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_dialog_7">
		<text>Alright. Come back in a day or so when everything's ready, but be prepared. This is going to be a very serious mission. I'll let you know via PDA. And yes, I advise you to go to the marshes. There's someone there who's interested in you.</text>

		<text>You don't regret putting me back together, out of pieces?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_0">
		<text>That's an interesting security detail you got there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_1">
		<text>They think, I don't know, that they've been assigned to me by the military... You're probably wondering why he's opening up. Uh, I don't read minds. Not really. Alright, files. Alright. Okay, it talks about some kind of psychotropic installations that are located in the zone in the north... Apparently, they're an obstacle. It also says that the scientist base on Yantar was supplying equipment for these antennas.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_2">
		<text>You know the legend of the Black Monolith?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_3">
		<text>Well, you could say I know almost nothing. I don't believe it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_4">
		<text>No one needs you to believe. I don't. Almost. Then what do you need?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_5">
		<text>Well done, clever boy. I do need you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_6">
		<text>I don't need you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_7">
		<text>Don't be rude.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_8">
		<text>Alright. (chuckles) I'll consider myself a good listener... for now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_9">
		<text>That's better. So, uh, about the Black Monolith. There are a number of once-secret laboratories in the Zone. When they were built and for what purpose, of course, no one is interested. Some of them, while they were functioning, were engaged in mutations, the soil was fertile. Once at the energy heart of the Zone, a nuclear power plant, there was an accident, an explosion of radioactive substances contaminated a fairly large area. A sarcophagus was erected, and the bulk of radioactive substances were buried under a multi-meter thick concrete. And within a radius of 30 kilometers around the territory became the Zone. But there were other laboratories on the territory of the Zone, which apparently appeared long before the catastrophe. Moreover, someone somewhere found separate documents that could suggest that the accident was the result of some mysterious experiments. Where and who saw such documents was not known. But the rumors were persistent. Rumors could not be gagged like poor Hoplite, rumors could not be taken out of circulation by a successful military operation or by groups like Duty, who carefully collected and destroyed paper information... Lately, it's been simply out of inertia. And one such rumor was the legend of the Black Monolith.
In one of the halls of the abandoned Sarcophagus, there was supposedly a device that fulfilled wishes. Materialized the most underlying desires. This tale even had an almost scientific basis. They say that an obscure device, originally associated with some esoteric-extrasensory things, under the influence of unknown processes occurring in the sarcophagus, acquired completely new properties associated with the transformation of time into space... or maybe vice versa.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_10">
		<text>The device itself may have existed and even functioned somehow, but what does it have to do with wishes? This is nonsense! What do you want me to do? You want me to go and make a wish for you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_11">
		<text>I could play hide-and-seek with you, but I don't have a wish. I mean play hide-and-seek, and I have plenty of wishes for the monolith. What I've heard about you forces me to play with open cards. There are three devices on the path to the monolith, some kind of RDs. Stalkers say they make your brain boil.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_12">
		<text>You think my brain is more fireproof?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_13">
		<text>Don't be sarcastic. If it's true that you're thrice-born, then you've been on the other side of the barrier that the RDs form.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_14">
		<text>Even if I was there, I don't remember anything about it. But am I the only one who's been there? There's Gobber.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_15">
		<text>Maybe there were others. They say Gunslinger was there, but nobody's seen him for a long time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_16">
		<text>Did you send him to the power plant?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_17">
		<text>I just told him how to try to do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_18">
		<text>How?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_barh_19">
		<text>Well, I'd start by going to one of the scientists' camps. You know, at least in the lakes area. They're-- Hold on, I got a visitor. Shit, you better go. It's in your best interest not to meet this man. Keep in mind, there's a lot of psi activity at the lake. If you don't want your brains fried, stay away from the central complex. Oh, by the way, since you're going to Yantar. Here you go -- artifact crossbreeder. You can think of it as a reward for the lab documents. Just be warned, there are no recipes in the device's memory. You can ask the scientists if you're going there. The road to Yantar is right here on the bar grounds. It's a former freeway. As you leave the bar, go straight southwest on the road, that's how you'll get to the lake. Oh, wait. I need time to arrange a meeting between you and the Professor, and there's still a lot of psi activity on the lake. So go to Silent Hills and scout out the military base area there. I'm interested in what's going on there in general. After that, you can move on to Yantar. That's it, go.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_bar_0">
		<text>Here are the documents Toad wanted to give to you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_bar_1">
		<text>So Messer himself. In the flesh. There's a rumor in the Zone that you, a stalker from the death truck, you've been nesting military nests... Well, here you are, right here. Well, this is the Stalker bar, so to speak, a staging area. Let's see what you brought back. Oh, not much. You're not gonna get a clear picture of what's going on here. You come back in a couple days, we'll figure out what we're gonna do. Have a drink at the bar with the guys, listen to some local stories. Toad asked me, after you give me the case, that you come see him, he's got some business for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_bar_2">
		<text>Well, what about the paperwork?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_bar_3">
		<text>What are you talking about? Ah... yeah, I got a result. So, uh. Some calculations, maps, installations. It says there's some kind of lab underneath the Dark Valley. There's some kind of research going on there. Listen to me. I think we need to find this place, and we need to find more documents. What you've got isn't enough. About the valley itself, it's not an easy place to find, there's something there that drives people crazy... like psi noise, you don't know where it comes from, but the fact is, regular stalkers don't usually come back from there. Or they do, but they come back as vegetables with their eyes closed. This psi noise can of course be bypassed by using a psi stabilizer. Almost all military personnel in the zone use them, they have them built into their defenses. I had a few of them, but I sold them. The scientists from the lake have them, but now it seems that all the passageways to them are blocked by the same radiation. Uh, talk to the snitch here, I think he might have one for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_bar_4">
		<text>Okay, so you're suggesting we go down to the lab?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_bar_5">
		<text>What do you think? Yeah, there's no other option. The paperwork explicitly lists a lab under Dark Valley. If you don't have the stomach for it, I'll find someone else.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_bar_6">
		<text>I'm going there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stader_bar_7">
		<text>Hmm. Yeah, Messer, that valley's a hell of a place. Stalkers don't go there much. You might want to stock up on some ammo from me, daredevil. I don't know what's waiting for you out there. The way to the Valley is on the east side of the Garbage. There are two paths to it. Well. take care. Oh, by the way. There's a group of Vets gathered around the yard on the left, see if they have anything for you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sokolov_kvest_dialog_0">
		<text>Is there a special job for me? I heard about the bloodsuckers around here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sokolov_kvest_dialog_1">
		<text>You heard right. Yeah, there's a job for you. But I doubt a man like you could handle it. You've been to Rostok before, haven't you? It may look like a quiet place, but it's not. Before the explosion, that factory was a special place because of what was produced there. And I'll tell you this, there's also rooms underneath the factory... That's where it's rumored to be the lair of a bloodsucker, an unusual one. Few people have seen such a thing, and those who have seen it may be lying. He's very different from the others in his bloodthirstiness. There was a bloodsucker researcher in the bar who was writing his dissertation on bloodsucker behavior. disappeared when I went to see him. He even dragged stalkers from the bar to his lair at night. And you, stalker, you're not exactly ordinary. I think you two deserve each other. What do you say. you think you can take the bastard down?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sokolov_kvest_dialog_2">
		<text>I'll do it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sokolov_kvest_dialog_3">
		<text>Another time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sokolov_kvest_dialog_completed_0">
		<text>The bloodsucker's dead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sokolov_kvest_dialog_completed_1">
		<text>Messer, goddamn it, you're alive. I can't believe you killed that bastard. Yes... I got something for you. You know where the Duty Force has set up shop?      Right across from their base, there's this place. The stalker who kept it disappeared a long time ago, I haven't seen him in over a year... Here's the key, you can settle in there. I haven't been there myself since the owner disappeared, and I don't need it, but you've done a great job. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot to tell you. Duty's leader asked to see you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sokolov_kvest_dialog_completed_2">
		<text>The house? Interesting. OK, thanks.</text>

		<text>Barkeep: How's the shack? You're not afraid of ghosts? I'm just kidding. I forgot to tell you, there's a safe in the house. It's good for storing stuff, so you can use it. And check the nightstands, see what you can find. Yeah, I think there was a generator on the roof. If you need light in the house, you can figure out how to run it, I guess.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_31">
		<text>As far as I know, experienced stalker, leader of one of the groups. Worked the northern exits of the Zone. Not many people have seen him around here, but rumor has it that he and his group went to the very center of the Zone.</text>

		<text>What is this place?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_41">
		<text>It's a former labor camp. It used to be home to workers who operated some kind of facility on the lake that's rumored to still be in operation.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_51">
		<text>An old stalker who's retired. Lives in the swamps, but nobody knows how to get there. He was once associated with Gunslinger's group.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_71">
		<text>As you may have heard, several government scientific organizations are studying the manifestations of our Zone. Rumor has it they're the ones who brought it to life with their experiments. Gunslinger and his group tried to find out if this is true, but as a result, Gunslinger's entire group was destroyed and he himself disappeared somewhere. The truth is unknown to me, only speculation. Scientific organizations leave in the Zone mobile scientific laboratories, metal bunkers isolated from the outside environment, inside everything that is necessary for life and study of the Zone. We're in contact with one such lab on Yantar. The scientists are good guys, they reveal us a lot of interesting information, and we also help them when we can... Heh-heh. Mutually beneficial barter, you know.</text>

		<text>What is a Wish Granter?</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_81">
		<text>Ooh! That's a very interesting question, and I wish I had the right answer. I can only tell you the legend of the Wish Granter, but how much of it is true is up to you. Will you listen to it?</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811">
		<text>Yes, it's very interesting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_8111">
		<text>It's the legend of the Monolith, quite possibly the cause of the Zone. In 2006, the Zone exploded, the population around it was evacuated and the Zone was cordoned off by the army. No one knew what was going on, there was panic, the Zone was growing, field labs were powerless. A lot of people died inside. Everyone is afraid of radiation, which can cover half of Europe. A few years go by, the first desperate guys like you show up. They called themselves stalkers. They penetrated through army cordons, believing that there was something in the Zone, something that would bring them riches. Slowly, they started bringing in strange things, artifacts, which were instantly chased. Scientists were going crazy, hysterical. They used to pay a lot of money for one of these specimens! Not like this.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811111">
		<text>So, the first stories and legends about what is inside the Zone, near the half-destroyed nuclear power plant appeared. Then one of the veterans retold a story heard from one of the local stalkers - old-timers, about the Monolith, supposedly fulfilling wishes. What hysteria began here, stalkers gathered in groups and rushed to the center of the Zone, everyone wanted something from the Monolith. There were grim details about the first stalker who got to the Monolith...</text>

	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_81111111">
		<text>When the Zone first appeared, many people were under its hood, cut off from the outside world. Most of them died immediately, but there were rare lucky ones who not only survived, but also tried to do something about it. One of the survivors was near the power plant, inside he saw a strange glow, he had no choice, the way back was cut off, and he got closer. He saw a picture of the Sarcophagus roof pierced through, with a glow coming out from underneath. He climbed up the wall and the inner view was revealed to him, a huge black shard of geometric shape rested amongst a pile of metal debris and charred concrete pancakes. This was the Monolith! Stalker finally awoke from his strange obsession and realized that he had literally climbed into the terribly phoned Sarcophagus. He was struck with a wild fear, through which the monotonous call of the Monolith pierced. The Monolith was calling him, and the stalker's hair stood on end, his head exploding with strange incredible pictures of the Monolith...</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_barmen_talk_info_811111112">
		<text>I don't know what's true or false in that story. The point is that he made a wish and it came true, and the Zone increased dramatically by five kilometers. It seems that for every wish granted, the Zone eats our Earth. But that doesn't stop brave guys like you. They keep on rushing in, carrying in their hearts their innermost desires...</text>

In fact, a year ago, two veteran stalkers accidentally discovered some documents. They contained data that explained what was behind the Chernobyl NPP... They went there and got lost.

		<text>The mystery of Yantar is similar to the mystery of the installation that is on the radar and does not let you go north. Their effects are similar in many ways. Unknown radiation zombifies all who fall under its influence. As a result, zombified stalkers move around the center of a certain emitter, attacking anyone who is not irradiated. There are reports that the lower levels of the Dark Lab contain the clue to Yantar. Here are the coordinates of the emitters on Lake Yantar and the installation on Radar. In addition, I'll give you the coordinates of the Dark Lab. In addition, when the blowout begins, the radiation of the installation begins to work in high mode... I suggest you seek shelter immediately. You could go crazy. Oh, and, uh, one last thing. Part of the Monolith group was zombified while exploring the lake. They disappeared somewhere in the central complex. So be doubly careful out there.</text>

	<string id="bar_bar_visitors_10_start_7111">
		<text>Interesting? Well, listen. Up north, not far from the Brain Scorcher, in an old military base, there's a group called Freedom. It's in zombie town. Freedom fighters, for fuck's sake! Fucking guerrillas! All they do is shoot up army units. I can only give you one piece of advice, never get involved with them, they only take the totally fucked up. Unless there's a bounty on your head, they won't take you... Ha-ha-ha-ha. Can you imagine that?</text>

		<text>You're new here? Haven't seen you before.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bar_bar_visitors_12_start_7111">
		<text>Yeah, there was a group. They were legendary throughout the Zone. Good and bad things were said about them, but few people knew the truth. And the truth is that they wanted to cope with the Zone, they wanted to dig out the reasons for its appearance. Military stalkers were hunting them, but they didn't know where to look. Government organizations knew something that ordinary stalkers shouldn't know. At one point they found some very important information and part of the group, along with Gunslinger, rushed to the center of the Zone. Half of the group died on the way, but they made it. Nobody knows what happened to them afterwards. They seem to have vanished. Meanwhile, the rest of the group was captured and slaughtered. and nobody survived. That's the story.</text>

		<text>The Kill Team is kind of like Freedom, only worse. Freedom at least has an idea, but these jackals are willing to do anything as long as you pay them.

		<text>We've been preparing to break through to the North for a long time. The only thing we were missing was the time period where the radiation cooled down, and the guy in the room got that information. From whom, I have absolutely no idea. We got halfway down the radar when the rig suddenly kicked on. One of them blew a roof off, lost consciousness and fell down the slope. I panicked, decided to drop everything and head back. Toth insisted on pulling the guy out, but it would have been pure suicide to go down and drag him all the way back up. I agreed, and he started down the slope just as another burst of radiation hit us. I came to my senses near the military base, until then I thought they were dead!

There's something better than a scattering of artifacts, something that doesn't belong to our world, something alien or from some other dimension. It's called a Wish Granter. I even heard a legend about a stalker who got to it. Only, they say the Zone grows after every wish fulfilled, and those who got there don't seem to wish for the Zone to disappear. Apparently, when you get to the executor already do not care about others, only their own skin cares!</text>

But, of course, you can't bomb the Zone, not only will the radiation spread all over the world, but the Zone's reaction could blow up half of Europe... Lately they've gone completely crazy...

Go there if you want to trade, socialize or get an interesting assignment, you'll also get the latest news. On the corner to the north is the base of the Duty faction. If you want to try to join Duty, you can go there, they will tell you who to contact.
